# RAWG Video Games

The purpose of this project is to practice my Typescript knowledge with an API. Moreover, I wanted to use Material UI to build the components and Redux toolkit query, along with Typescript, to handle API requests. 

This project is also a gateway project to React testing. Since finishing this project, I have been learning to write unit and integration tests with Jest and React testing library. My future plan for this project is to test the application.
