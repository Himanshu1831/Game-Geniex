# RAWG Video Games

[Demo](https://rawg-video-games-serey-roth.netlify.app)

The purpose of this project is to practice my Typescript knowledge with an API. Moreover, I wanted to use Material UI to build the components and Redux toolkit query, along with Typescript, to handle API requests. 

This project is also a gateway project to React testing. Since finishing this project, I have been learning to write unit and integration tests with Jest and React testing library. My future plan for this project is to test the application.

All data and images are retrieved from RAWG Game API and belong solely to RAWG. 

## Update (12/06/2022): 
* Swapped out Redux toolkit query for React Query to handle HTTP requests
* Wrote custom hooks for fetching games and game details
* Tested components using Jest and React Testing Library
* Wrote unit tests for gameAPI object and tested api with mocked fetch
